# Cloud Computing 2024 Assignment 1

Each folder contains a separate purpose, Tasks 1 and 2 folders include what is required to fulfill tasks 1 and 2 for the assignment.
The Application folder contains an Angular project, and is the visual UI that is ran to perform the rest of the tasks.
The Lambda Functions folder include all lambda functions used with API Gateway with the application.

Extra details for each section are included in the corresponding README.md for that given section. (Lambda Functions are self-explanatory so I have not included a README for it.)
